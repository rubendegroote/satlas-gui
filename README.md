# satlas-gui

This library aims to provide a graphical user interface to the code in the 
satlas repository.

Right now, the scope is just to provide viewers of analysis that was 
performed using the command-line interface of satlas. In a later stage,
interactive fitting software could be considered.

Development of this repo will go hand in hand with developments of the 
satlas libraries.
